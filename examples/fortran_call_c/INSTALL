Decide whether you are a regular user or developer. Choose a set of build instructions below
based on your decision. 

[For Regular Users] 
To make an in-source build:

1) check out the RBF.framework from SVN
2) Start build: 
	cd RBF.framework
	cmake .
	make  

[For Developers] 
I usually make an out-of-source build so the CMake temp and build files do not muck with the source tree

1) check out the RBF.framework from SVN 
2) make the out of core build directory (OUTSIDE of RBF.framework):
	mkdir <BUILD_DIR>				(e.g. mkdir rbf-build) 
	cd <BUILD_DIR>					(e.g. cd rbf-build) 
	cmake <PATH_TO_RBF.FRAMEWORK>	(e.g. cmake ../RBF.framework)
	make 


[For Users and Developers]

Existing make targets: 

make 						// Build library and tests
make test					// Run ALL tests (use command "ctest" for SUBSET)
make doc					// Run doxygen
make package-source			// Build a source tarball for distribution


Required software: 

Armadillo v0.8.2 			(http://arma.sourceforge.net)
FFTW 3.2.2 
gordon_tests/utilities/libutilities.a 	(from https://svn.sc.fsu.edu/svn/collab-ge-bj/src/gordon_tests/utilities)
OpenMPI  				(Installed by default on OSX10.6)


If you run cmake from the top directory it will default to forcing 32 bit builds (change behavior with boolean option or edit common/COMMON_CONFIG.cmake). Unfortunately, I cant get 32bit builds to work with mpi on linux yet. Here is an example usage (2 cases): 

# 1) For 32-bit builds: 
cmake .
make
file tests/fortran_call_c/fortran_call_c.x

# 2) For 64-bit builds (on x86_64 architecture; otherwise 32-bit on x86 arch): 
# (NOTE: after specifying the option OFF you will need to turn it back ON (i.e., -DFORCE_32BIT=ON) manually or wipe the whole build cache to get 32 bit again)
cmake -DFORCE_32BIT=OFF .
make
file tests/fortran_call_c/fortran_call_c.x  


Additional Notes: 
===============
1) To change the path for gordon_tests (i.e. the parent directory for the required utilities library),
   modify RBF.framework/CMakeLists.txt

	   Line 5:
		SET(GLIB ~/gordon_tests)

   CMake will search ${GLIB}/utilities to find libutilities.a

2) To test a SUBSET of the tests in RBF.framework/tests you cannot use "make test".
   Instead, call CTest directly (from BUILD_DIR or whatever directory you ran "make" in): 

	$> ctest -R <regex> 
   
   where <regex> is a regular expression matched against all test names; only matches will 
   be executed. For example (given tests "template", "mytest", "my_template_copy"): 

	$> ctest -R temp

   will execute tests: "template" and "my_template_copy"
   but not: "mytest"


3) The tests subdirectory has a few tests setup to run using MPI_EXEC. Output by default goes to 

   	build/Testing/LastTest.log

   To manually execute (from directory: BUILD_DIR):

	cd tests/<testname>
	make && mpiexec -np [#ofProcs] ./<testname> [options]

   where the [options] are intended for the test executable. To get a list of available option
   execute: 
	./<testname> --help 

4) For instructions on creating tests see RBF.framework/tests/README



OS Specific Notes:
